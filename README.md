## ü§∑ About
This is the companion native app for  [footsteps-app](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-app) .This cross-platform application is being developed for the Android and iOS platforms using the Flutter SDK by Google. 

With Footsteps [app](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-flutter-app) & [browser extension](https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-extension), we take a mentor/subject knowledge expert first approach to solve the problem. This flutter app would help individuals to add/manage links in their learning paths. It works just like the browser extension is working right now.

## üßê The Need (as seen on the web)

Here are few examples of why we came up with footsteps:

## ‚è™ Prerequisites

![Pass](https://media.giphy.com/media/Z9cRCMdAMzXi25dwhE/giphy.gif)


* Make sure you have Flutter installed (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* Try installing and experimenting with the development version on your phone
* Don't hesitate in asking questions, we'll be happy to help

## Installation 

    $ git clone https://github.com/fnplus/footsteps-flutter-app.git
    $ cd footsteps-flutter-app/
    $ flutter run

## Install Dependencies
Below are the dependencies you will need for most FlutterFire apps, assuming you are using Firestore and Google SignIn.

<b>pubspec.yaml</b>
```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  firebase_core: ^0.4.0
  firebase_analytics: ^1.0.4

  firebase_auth:  ^0.6.6
  google_sign_in: ^3.2.4

```

## Android Setup

1. Make sure you have an Android emulator installed and running.
2. ### SHA1 Certificate
   * First, fill [this](https://airtable.com/shrOevwzFNas0wis3) form to request access to the firebase project.
   * Next, generate an <i>SHA1 certificate</i> to allow Firebase to provision an OAuth2 client and API key when using Google Sign-in and/or dynamic links.
3. ### Download and save the google-services.json
   * Download the <b>google-services.json</b> file to the <b>android/app</b> directory. At this point, you can skip all remaining steps in the Firebase console (Flutter does this stuff automatically).

   <img src="https://fireship.io/img/snippets/android-flutter-file-dir.png">
4. ### Update the build.gradle files
    * Now we need to register our Google services in the Gradle build files.

    <b>android/build.gradle</b>
    ```

    buildscript 
    {
   dependencies
    {
       // ...
       classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.2.1'   // <-- here
    }
    }
    ```

 5. That‚Äôs it. Try executing flutter run with an Android device emulated or plugged-in to verify the setup worked.

## iOS Setup

 The iOS setup is less tedious and can be completed in one step.

 * ### Register and Download the <b>GoogleService-Info.plist</b>
 Click <i>add your app to iOS</i> then download the <b>GoogleService-Info.plist</b> file into the ios/Runner/Runner directory from XCode.


## Troubleshooting
At this point, you should be able to serve the app by running <b>flutter run.</b>

* Run <i><b>flutter doctor</b><i> and resolve any detected issues 
* Open the app in Android Studio or XCode and build it. Inspect the logs.
* If your app crashes at startup without logs it may be because you changed the id in the <i><b>AndroidManifest.xml</b></i> file.
